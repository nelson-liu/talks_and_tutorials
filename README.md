## Running reveal.js Presentations
To run the presentations generated by `jupyter nbconvert`, you need a folder named `reveal.js` in the same directory as the `*.slides.html` file, the contents of which should be [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/). I've included a git submodule of the version of reveal.js used at presentation time, but feel free to put in the latest copy / a version you like.
